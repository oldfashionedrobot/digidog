CS-8803-ANI project - Digital Stimuli for Dogs


### To Run
1: Load the arduinocode.ino onto your board, can just copy paste the code into Arduino IDE. Change the WiFi SSID and password in the code to match your local network.

2: Open the Serial monitor when starting the board, to see the board's IP address logged once it connects to the network.

3: Open the index.html file in your browser, and enter in the IP address of the board into the input field. 

4: Clicking the on/off links should then hit the relevant endpoints on the Arduino's server and toggle on/off the corresponding pins.
